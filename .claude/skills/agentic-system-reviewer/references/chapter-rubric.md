## Chapter Trigger Matrix

| Chapter | Trigger In Artifacts | Check For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ch.01 One Tool Call | First tool, function calling, schemas | Does the schema match the handler? Are errors returned to the model as usable tool results? |
| Ch.02 Agent Loop | loop, max steps, retries, stop, cancellation | Are stop conditions explicit? Are doom loops, errors, parallel calls, and cancellation handled for the scope? |
| Ch.03 Tools Validation | tool registry, permissions, idempotency, dry-run | Are tools typed, validated, permissioned, idempotent where needed, and wrapped in result envelopes? |
| Ch.04 Prompts Context Cache | system prompt, context builder, cache, prefix | Is prompt assembly deterministic? Are stable prefix and volatile tail separated? Does live memory break cache? |
| Ch.05 Short-Term Memory | transcript, compaction, scratchpad, tool output size | Are audit log, operating view, and scratchpad separated? Are tool results clipped/deduped/compacted? |
| Ch.06 Long-Term Recall | vector DB, search, memory retrieval, skill index | Is retrieval chosen by access pattern? Are namespaces, ranking, budget, and observability present? |
| Ch.07 Memory Writing | write memory, preferences, curation, learned facts | Is writing separated from retrieval? Are safety filters, provenance, conflict resolution, rollback, and user controls present? |
| Ch.08 State Persistence | resume, crash, checkpoints, long run, worker | Is state durable at step boundaries? Are in-flight tools, idempotency, heartbeats, and resume paths handled? |
| Ch.09 Planning | checklist, plan, replan, dependency graph | Is the planning shape appropriate? Are plans stateful, editable, and revalidated at step boundaries? |

| Ch.22 Design Canvas | overall idea, PRD, architecture | Are use case, goal, scope, budget, users, success criteria, and worst-case mistake explicit? |

## Chapter Selection Guard

Pick the smallest set of chapters that can explain the real risks, normally 3-6 chapters. If more than 6 chapters look central, do not review against the entire course in one pass. Flag the artifact as too broad, split the review by subsystem, or ask which slice matters most.

## Scope-Aware Expectations

### Learning Sketch
Must have:
- One concrete behavior.
- Simple loop or tool-call shape.
- Clear next experiment.

Should not be forced to have:
- Durable backend, full observability, runbooks, multi-agent orchestration.

### Hobby Prototype
Must have:
- Narrow V0 scope.
- Safe memory policy if memory exists.
- Explicit stop condition if loop exists.
- One notification/channel rule if proactive.

Should defer:
- Multi-tenant isolation, complex queues, full incident response.

### Internal Team Tool
Must have:
- Tool contracts and permission tiers.
- Basic durable state for long-running work.
- Approval for external/destructive actions.
- Trace/log evidence for debugging.

### Customer-Facing Production
Must have:
- All high-impact tools behind Ch.12 gates or deterministic policy.
- Ch.16 traces/evals/cost visibility.
- Ch.18 trust boundaries and adversarial input defenses.
- Ch.19 runbooks and operational ownership.
- Ch.08/Ch.15 durability when work outlives a request.

## Chapter Review Questions

Use these when writing findings.

### Loop and Tools: Ch.01-Ch.03
- Can the model call only known tools?
- Are arguments schema-validated and semantically validated?
- Are errors returned as recoverable messages rather than crashes?
- Are destructive, external, or non-idempotent tools labeled?
- Is there a stop reason other than "ran out of steps"?

### Prompt and Memory: Ch.04-Ch.07
- What is stable prefix vs volatile tail?
- Does memory retrieval include provenance, ranking, namespaces, and budget?
- Does memory writing have a safety filter and user-visible controls?
- Are summaries/compaction auditable and not silently lossy for important facts?

### State, Planning, Delegation, Harness: Ch.08-Ch.11
- What is persisted after each step?
- What happens after process restart or tool crash?
- Is the plan shape the simplest that fits?
- Are subagents bounded by task, tools, context, depth, budget, and output schema?
- Does the harness have clear lifecycle and hook boundaries?

### External Surface: Ch.12-Ch.14
- Which tools require allow/ask/deny?
- What does the human see before approving?
- Are channel/webhook events authenticated, deduped, and normalized?
- Is each extension a skill, MCP server, built-in tool, or subagent for the right reason?

### Production Layer: Ch.15-Ch.19
- Is execution decoupled from request handling when needed?
- Are secrets, tenant scope, backups, rate limits, and cost ledgers defined?
- Is observability sufficient to replay or explain a bad run?
- Are safety controls layered before and after model calls?
- Is there a runbook for the worst plausible mistake?

### Agency: Ch.20-Ch.21
- Is proactive behavior opt-in and digestible?
- What prevents notification flood or unattended cost?
- Are self-updates proposed, evaluated, versioned, and reversible?
- Which parts are forbidden to self-modify?

## Cross-Cutting Design Lenses

Use these lenses after chapter selection so the review catches failure modes that do not live neatly in one chapter.

| Lens | Ask | Usual Chapter Anchors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reversibility | Which actions cannot be undone, and who approves them? | Ch.03, Ch.12, Ch.18 |
| Cost envelope | What is the spend/latency ceiling, and what enforces it? | Ch.02, Ch.16, Ch.17, Ch.20 |
| Eval plan | How will the team know the agent works before production observability exists? | Ch.16, Ch.18, Ch.22 |
| Doom-loop protection | What stops repeated tool calls, retries, notifications, or self-updates? | Ch.02, Ch.08, Ch.17, Ch.20-Ch.21 |
| Data boundary | What data can cross users, tenants, channels, prompts, and memory? | Ch.06-Ch.08, Ch.13, Ch.18 |
| Human ownership | Who can intervene, approve, rollback, and explain outcomes? | Ch.12, Ch.16, Ch.19 |

Failure-mode quick map:
- Cost overrun: Ch.17 plus Ch.16 for cost events and Ch.20 for unattended background work.
- Memory poisoning or stale preference: Ch.07 plus Ch.18, usually Ch.06 for retrieval scope.
- Unauthorized external action: Ch.03 plus Ch.12 and Ch.18.
- Cross-customer leak: Ch.06, Ch.08, Ch.13, Ch.15, Ch.18.
- Runaway loop or notification flood: Ch.02, Ch.08, Ch.17, Ch.20.
- Bad self-update: Ch.21 plus Ch.16 for eval evidence and Ch.19 for rollback.

## Finding Construction

Every problem finding must include:
- Evidence: doc section, code path, or observed omission.
- Course anchor: chapter and concept.
- Scope calibration: why it matters for this tier.
- Impact: concrete failure mode.
- Fix: smallest change appropriate for current scope.

Every strength must include:
- What to preserve.
- Why it fits the course.
- What could break it later.
